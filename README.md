# Asteroids

A Python implementation of the classic *Asteroids* game, with modular components (player, asteroids, shooting, collision, etc.).

## Features

- Real-time asteroid field generation  
- Player with thrust, rotation, and shooting mechanics  
- Collision detection (ship ↔ asteroids, bullets ↔ asteroids)  
- Lives, scorekeeping, and game over logic  
- Modular code architecture (separate modules for shapes, constants, etc.)

## Requirements & Setup

- This project uses **Python 3.x**.
- You will also need the supporting libraries used in the project , `pygame` and `tkinter`.
