# Asteroids

A Python implementation of the classic *Asteroids* game, with modular components (player, asteroids, shooting, collision, etc.).

## Features

- Real-time asteroid field generation  
- Player with thrust, rotation, and shooting mechanics  
- Collision detection (ship ↔ asteroids, bullets ↔ asteroids)  
- Lives, scorekeeping, and game over logic  
- Modular code architecture (separate modules for shapes, constants, etc.)

## Requirements & Setup

- This project uses **Python 3.x**.
- You will also need `pygame`.
- - **uv** installed  
  If you don’t have `uv`, install it with:

  ```bash
  pip install uv 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dvdandrades/Asteroids.git
   cd Asteroids

2. Install dependencies with uv
    ```bash
    uv sync
